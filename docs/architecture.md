# Architecture

How AetherEngine is put together: the three playback pipelines, the source-file map, and the dependency surface. For the public API and integration, see the [README](../README.md); for format and codec depth, [docs/formats.md](formats.md).

## Playback pipelines

AetherEngine has three playback pipelines, picked once at `load(url:)`: the audio-only path when `LoadOptions.audioOnly` is set, otherwise the native or software video path based on the source's video codec.

### Native AVPlayer pipeline (default)

Demux the source with libavformat, re-mux the elementary streams on the fly into HLS-fMP4, serve them from a local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<port>`, point `AVPlayer` at the playlist. Apple's stack does all decode, all HDR / Dolby Vision signaling over HDMI, all audio routing. This is the path for HEVC and H.264, which is what AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline reliably accepts. Atmos passthrough, DV HDMI handshake, HDR10 / HDR10+ system-side tone-mapping all live on this path.

Why HLS-fMP4 for the native path instead of feeding `AVPlayer` the source URL directly: AVPlayer's progressive-download path won't accept arbitrary MKV containers, and even for MP4 sources it's brittle around Dolby Vision sample-description quirks and EAC3 `dec3` box variants. The HLS-fMP4 wrapper is the most permissive surface AVPlayer exposes; libavformat's `hls` muxer produces bytes byte-identical to `ffmpeg -f hls -hls_segment_type fmp4`, which is what Apple's HLS spec is defined against.

The playlist's segment boundaries come from a keyframe-aligned plan that mirrors the `hls` muxer's cut algorithm (segment N ends at the first IRAP at-or-after `(N+1) * targetSegmentDuration`), built in `HLSVideoEngine+SegmentPlanning.swift`. It needs the source's keyframe positions, which for MKV / MP4 come from a brief cue prewarm (a bounded seek that loads the Cues / `stss` index) and for MPEG-TS / M2TS come only from whatever `avformat_find_stream_info` plus that seek happened to scan. `keyframeIndexIsTrustworthy` gates the plan on two witnesses before trusting that index, falling back to a uniform-stride plan otherwise: the largest **gap** between consecutive keyframes must stay under a cap (a clustered TS index gaps by thousands of seconds; trusting it builds a multi-thousand-second first segment the `frag_custom` muxer buffers whole in RAM, #64), and the **coverage** from first to last indexed keyframe must span at least one `targetSegmentDuration`. The coverage check catches a remote MKV whose Cues tail read fails: the prewarm loads nothing, only the open-time keyframes survive bunched in the first few seconds, their gaps are tiny so the gap check passes, yet no keyframe reaches the first segment boundary, so the keyframe planner would degenerate to a single whole-file segment AVPlayer loads zero tracks from (`kFigAssetError_TrackNotFound`, #91). The uniform fallback anchors segment 0 at the content start so a late-starting title doesn't advertise empty leading segments.

At runtime the producer honors those boundaries with a keyframe-gated, decode-order cut (`VODSegmentCutter`): a segment opens only at the IRAP whose PTS reaches the next boundary, so the IRAP is the segment's first sample and its open-GOP leading pictures stay with it, matching the live path and the `hls` muxer. The earlier routing keyed each packet to a segment by its DTS against the PTS-valued boundaries, so under B-frame reorder a keyframe whose DTS trailed its PTS fell into the previous segment and the next one started mid-GOP, decode-dependent on its predecessor; a fresh decode at that boundary (rebuffer recovery) surfaced it as transient blocky corruption (#92).

Seeks are demand-driven: `AVPlayer` just fetches segments at the new position, and `VideoSegmentProvider` only tears the producer down and re-anchors it at the requested index (`restartHandler`, burst-coalesced by `RestartCoalescer`) when the request cannot be served from `SegmentCache`. A restart is the expensive path (it re-seeks the demuxer, slow on remote sources, #93), so for VOD the cache retains already-produced segments beyond its hard `[target - backwardWindow, target + forwardWindow]` window under a byte budget (2 GiB, clamped to a quarter of the tmp volume's free capacity), evicting farthest-from-target first once it fills. A seek back into the retained span, and the forward march that follows it, is then a pure cache hit with zero producer restarts; only a seek into never-produced content restarts. Live sessions keep window-only pruning, since the sliding playlist has already dropped everything behind the window. Restarts on a slow link are further contained (#93 residual): a fetch that is waiting for an in-flight restart rides its progress instead of burning a fixed retry budget into a 503 (and never re-fires a restart at its own stale index), the wedged-restart fresh reopen skips `find_stream_info` (the session already holds saved codec configs and the segment plan), lazy native subtitle readers defer while a restart executes, and the FIRST producer of a resumed session anchors directly at the resume segment instead of producing seg0 into an immediate teardown.

When a restart does run, it must reproduce segments on the SAME media timeline the continuous run gave them: the loopback's contract with AVPlayer is "static VOD server", and AVPlayer anchors fMP4 segments by their `tfdt`. Each restart allocates a fresh mp4 muxer, and movenc zero-bases a new instance's timeline by default, so a restart-produced segment used to carry `tfdt=0` while the playlist placed it at its plan offset: an implicit timeline discontinuity on every restart, papered over for plain playback but fatal to ancillary consumers (AVKit's legible renderer detaches mid-PiP, Sodalite#32; playhead/loaded-range decoupling, #93). The muxer therefore sets `movflags +frag_discont` with `avoid_negative_ts=disabled` so `tfdt` carries the producer's absolute output timestamps, the restart audio gate inherits the session shift (video shift rescaled) instead of snapping audio onto the video seam, and leading head-of-stream audio that would map below 0 is dropped (the muxer no longer absorbs negative timestamps). A restarted segment is byte-identical to its continuous twin modulo the per-muxer `mfhd` sequence number (pinned by `RestartTimelineContinuityTests` on a committed A/V fixture); on matroska sources, per-sample DTS synthesis after a demuxer seek scatters the DTS decomposition and boundary-frame membership by a frame or two, but presentation timestamps and `tfdt` anchoring stay epoch-invariant.

### Software decoder pipeline (AV1 + VP9 + VP8 + legacy fallback)

Demux the source, run video packets through libavcodec (dav1d for AV1, FFmpeg's native decoder for VP9 / VP8 / MPEG-4 Part 2 / MPEG-2 / VC-1) into `CVPixelBuffer`s, run audio through libavcodec into `CMSampleBuffer`s, render via `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` + `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` with `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer` as the master clock. Used for codecs AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline doesn't accept: AV1 (no Apple TV currently ships an AV1 hardware decoder, and Apple bundles dav1d only on iOS / macOS, so AV1 always routes here today; the engine still registers the supplemental VideoToolbox AV1 decoder and gates on `VTIsHardwareDecodeSupported` (`VTCapabilityProbe`), so a future Apple TV chip with HW AV1 is picked up automatically), VP9 / VP8 (AVPlayer parses the HLS manifest, sees `vp09` / `vp08` in the CODECS attribute, then silently stops fetching — `item.status` never leaves `.unknown`. VideoToolbox HW-decodes VP9 fine, but only outside the HLS pipeline), and legacy MPEG-4 Part 2 (XVID / DIVX / SP / ASP), MPEG-2 video, and VC-1 (none of `mp4v.20.X` / `mp2v` / `vc-1` are in Apple's HLS Authoring Spec CODECS list).

A seek holds the last frame on screen rather than blanking it. `SampleBufferRenderer.flush()` takes a `removingDisplayedImage` flag (`DisplayFlushOp` is the pure decision split out for testing): stop/teardown clears the visible frame (the default), but `SoftwarePlaybackHost.seek()` passes `false`, so the previous frame stays up until the post-seek keyframe decodes instead of flashing black on slow sources like MPEG-2. This matches the native/AVPlayer path, which holds the frame through a seek (#90).

`AudioDecoder` stamps each `CMSampleBuffer` from a running sample count anchored to the first frame (`AudioClockAnchor`), not from the container-quantized per-packet PTS. Container timebases are coarse (1 ms in MKV), so when a frame's duration is not an integer number of ticks (a 1536-sample AC-3 frame is 34.83 ms at 44.1 kHz but exactly 32 ms at 48 kHz) the quantized PTS leave a sub-millisecond gap or overlap at every buffer boundary, and `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` reconciles a discontinuity at each one (~29 clicks/sec, a continuous crackle). Anchoring to the sample clock makes consecutive buffers abut exactly; a real source discontinuity (> 100 ms off the predicted clock, i.e. a seek or edit) re-anchors so genuine gaps are not papered over, and `flush()` drops the anchor. The clock advances only on a successfully emitted buffer, so a dropped buffer injects no phantom samples.

AV1+DV (Profile 10.0 / 10.1 / 10.4) routes through the native path on hardware-AV1 hosts via the `dav1` / `av01` track type plus the source's `dvvC` box. AV1+Atmos is genuinely rare in the wild (mastering still runs in HEVC overwhelmingly), so the SW pipeline's lack of Atmos passthrough is a theoretical limitation rather than a real one. The dispatch happens once at load time; hosts see a unified `@Published` state surface either way.

**Background audio (iOS).** When the app backgrounds while playing, the engine keeps audio going rather than tearing the pipeline down. The decision is a pure, unit-tested policy, `backgroundAction(isAudioBackend:hasSoftwareHost:keepVideoAlive:state:)`, driven from the `UIApplication` lifecycle observers; `keepVideoAlive` comes from `shouldKeepVideoAlive(enabled:pipActive:state:)` and is gated to iOS (tvOS always tears down, wedge-safe: a frozen decode session crossing a multi-hour suspension wedged `mediaserverd`). On the native path "keep audio alive" is just declining to tear down: `AVPlayer` under the `.playback` session keeps decoding. The software path has no `AVPlayer`, and its combined demux loop normally paces the whole loop (audio and video) on the video renderer's `isReadyForMoreMediaData`; once `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` stops draining in the background that gate never reopens and audio would starve. So the host enters `backgroundAudioOnly`: the loop drops video packets and paces on the audio renderer (`AudioOutput.isReadyForMoreMediaData`) instead, keeping `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` fed and the synchronizer advancing. On foreground return the flag clears, the video decoder and renderer flush, and video resyncs at the next keyframe with audio uninterrupted. Scope is the combined VOD loop (and live-without-DVR, which shares it); the DVR feeder loop is unchanged. Exercise it headless with `aetherctl bgaudio` (see [cli.md](cli.md)).

### Audio-only pipeline (music, podcasts, audiobooks)

When the host sets `LoadOptions.audioOnly`, the engine skips the video machinery entirely: no HLS loopback server, no segment producer, no display layer. Decode is native-first. Codecs on the `avPlayerCanDecodeAudio` whitelist hand the source URL straight to a bare `AVPlayer` (`AudioAVPlayerHost`); everything else demuxes through libavformat and decodes through libavcodec into an `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` (`AudioPlaybackHost`). Transport (`play` / `pause` / `seek`) routes to the active host, and `stopInternal` tears it down for a clean handoff back to the video path on the next load.

```
audioOnly == true
   ├─ whitelisted codec ──► AVPlayer (AudioAVPlayerHost) ──► AVR / speakers
   └─ otherwise          ──► Demuxer ──► AudioDecoder ──► AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer ──► AVR / speakers
```

On tvOS and iOS the AVPlayer audio host owns a persistent per-player `MPNowPlayingSession` (exposed via `audioNowPlayingSession`) so the system Now-Playing overlay stays bound to the app across a background pause, auto-publishes now-playing info from the player, and carries `externalMetadata`. The host survives across tracks and does not pause when the app backgrounds. All of this is gated `#if os(tvOS) || os(iOS)`; on macOS the path compiles and plays without the system session (a macOS host drives Now-Playing through the shared centers itself).

### Playback status (`playbackPhase`)

`AetherEngine.playbackPhase` is the single observable for what playback is doing right now, across all three pipelines. It is *derived*, not a parallel state machine: a pure fold of `state`, `isBuffering`, `isSeeking`, and a typed source-reconnect axis, recomputed on every input change so it can never desync from them. Each input's `didSet` triggers an idempotent recompute that re-emits only on an actual change.

Precedence (highest first): `error > ended > idle > loading > seeking > stalled > rebuffering > playing/paused`.

- `.rebuffering` is a healthy-connection buffer underrun (AVPlayer waiting to play); `state` stays `.playing` across it.
- `.stalled(reconnecting:)` is a source-connection problem (drop / 429 / 503 backoff) where the `AVIOReader` is retrying. It is promoted from log text to a typed signal: the reader pushes a `flowing` / `reconnecting` phase through `Demuxer.onNetworkPhaseChanged`, the owning host (`HLSVideoEngine` on the native path, the software / audio hosts directly) forwards it, and the engine hops it to the main actor. The flag is `true` whenever the reader is reconnecting; the `false` case is reserved for a future "stalled, retries paused" distinction. The subtitle side-demuxer is deliberately left unwired so its stalls never move `playbackPhase`.
- The direct AVPlayer-HLS live path (`nativeRemoteHLS`) and the whitelisted-codec audio host (`AudioAVPlayerHost`) have no demuxer / `AVIOReader`, so they cannot report `.stalled`; a reconnect there reads as `.rebuffering`.

Hosts should observe `$playbackPhase` instead of combining `state == .loading`, `$isBuffering`, and `$isSeeking`, and instead of regex-matching `EngineLog` for stall / reconnect, which is no longer needed.

## SwiftUI `Menu` in custom player chrome

On tvOS 26, the focused row of an open SwiftUI `Menu` blinks whenever any SwiftUI render transaction runs in the hosting tree, even one fully contained in an unrelated leaf view (a `TimelineView(.periodic)` wall clock, a playbar observing `engine.clock`, a subtitle overlay). Minimal repro: a `Menu` next to a `TimelineView(.periodic(from: .now, by: 1))`, open the menu, the focused item blinks once per second. This is a SwiftUI issue, not an engine one; reported to Apple by an AetherEngine adopter (see [AetherEngine#29](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/issues/29)).

The engine keeps its own surfaces out of the blast radius by splitting every continuously ticking value off the engine's `ObservableObject` (`engine.clock` at ~10 Hz, `engine.diagnostics` at 1 Hz). But a player UI always has something ticking, so if your custom chrome needs a dropdown while playback runs, build the menu button in UIKit and let SwiftUI host it. `UIButton` with `button.menu` + `showsMenuAsPrimaryAction` renders the same system menu as SwiftUI's `Menu` (public API since tvOS 17), and a `UIViewRepresentable` wrapper can guarantee the open dropdown is never rebuilt:

```swift
struct TrackMenuButton: UIViewRepresentable {
    let items: [TrackMenuItem]

    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIButton { /* configure once */ }

    func updateUIView(_ button: UIButton, context: Context) {
        // Same-value reassignment tears down an open dropdown. Only
        // replace the UIMenu when the items actually changed.
        if context.coordinator.currentItems != items {
            context.coordinator.currentItems = items
            button.menu = buildMenu(from: items)
        }
    }
}
```

SwiftUI diffing can re-run `updateUIView` as often as it likes; the guard means an open menu only rebuilds on a real item change. Credit to [@ohjey](https://github.com/ohjey) for isolating the mechanism and the pattern (AetherEngine#29).

The `AetherEngineSMB` product is a separate, opt-in target so its AMSMB2 (LGPL-2.1) dependency never enters the core engine binary. Hosts that need LAN-share playback link it and hand the engine an `smb://` source via the standard `IOReader` seam:

```
Sources/AetherEngineSMB/
├── AetherEngineSMB.swift                    Product entry point: opt-in SMB2/3 byte source, depends on AMSMB2 (libsmb2); never linked by the core engine
├── SMBURL.swift                             Parses smb://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/share/path URLs (missing credentials default to guest)
├── SMBConnection.swift                      Read-only SMB2/3 byte source over one share + path via AMSMB2 (per-read open/seek/close, no persistent handle)
├── ByteRangeSource.swift                    Random-access read-only byte-source protocol, isolates the network backend from cursor / seek logic for testability
└── SMBIOReader.swift                        Bridges a ByteRangeSource into the engine's IOReader (blocking read via a happens-before semaphore edge)
```

The `aetherctl` CLI target (`Sources/aetherctl/`) is documented separately in [docs/cli.md](cli.md).

## Dependencies

| Package | License | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [FFmpegBuild](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/FFmpegBuild) | LGPL-3.0 | Slim FFmpeg 8.1 (avcodec / avformat / avutil / swresample / swscale / avfilter + zimg) for demux + HLS-fMP4 mux + AudioBridge FLAC encode + SW-path dav1d decode + sws_scale YUV → NV12 / P010. avfilter ships a trimmed filter set: zscale + tonemap + colorspace (HDR → SDR still extraction), bwdif + yadif (SW-path deinterlacing) |
| [LibDovi](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/LibDovi) | MIT / Apache-2.0 | libdovi (the `dolby_vision` crate's C API) for live Dolby Vision Profile 7 to single-layer 8.1 RPU conversion (`dovi_convert_rpu_with_mode`, mode 2), so the Apple TV engages real DV on dual-layer UHD-BD remuxes instead of plain HDR10. Prebuilt xcframework, no Rust at the consumer's build time |
| VideoToolbox | System | Native path video decode (HW where available, Apple's bundled SW dav1d on iOS / macOS) |
| AVFoundation | System | AVPlayer + AVDisplayManager (native path); AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer + AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer (SW path) |
| CoreMedia | System | Sample descriptions, format-description tagging, CMTimebase |
