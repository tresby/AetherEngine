## What it is

A player engine that gets the hard parts right (HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, container coverage, codec coverage) and exposes a single `AetherPlayerView` (UIKit / AppKit) or `AetherPlayerSurface` (SwiftUI) plus a handful of `async` methods. No `AVPlayerViewController`. No opinionated controls. No analytics. Bind the view, call `play()`, read the published properties for state.

The view is polymorphic: under the hood the engine swaps the hosted CALayer (`AVPlayerLayer` for the native AVPlayer path, `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` for the SW dav1d fallback path) per session without the host having to know.

You provide the transport bar. You provide the dropdowns. You provide the pretty.

## What it handles

| Area        | Details                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Containers  | MKV, MP4, WebM, MPEG-TS, AVI, OGG, FLV (demux side)                                                                         |
| HW decode   | H.264, HEVC, HEVC Main10 via VideoToolbox in AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 path. AV1 on devices with HW AV1 (M3+ Mac, iPhone 15 Pro+, future Apple TV chips) also routes natively |
| SW decode   | AV1 (libavcodec/dav1d) on devices without HW AV1 — currently all Apple TVs, M1/M2 Macs, pre-A17-Pro iPhones. VP9 and VP8 (libavcodec native) unconditionally, since AVPlayer's HLS pipeline rejects the `vp09` / `vp08` CODECS attributes even where VT can HW-decode them. MPEG-4 Part 2 (XVID / DIVX / SP / ASP), MPEG-2 video, and VC-1 also route SW since AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline does not accept them; libavcodec ships native decoders for all three. All render through `SoftwareVideoDecoder` + `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`. Dispatch decision lives in `AetherEngine.load`, gated per source on `VTCapabilityProbe` and codec id |
| HDR10       | BT.2020 + PQ signaled via the HLS-fMP4 wrapper; AVPlayer hands the bitstream to the system HDR pipeline                     |
| HDR10+      | Per-frame ST 2094-40 dynamic metadata preserved through stream-copy into the HLS-fMP4 wrapper                               |
| Dolby Vision| HEVC P5 / P8.1 / P8.4 with `dvh1` / `hvc1` track type + `dvcC` box. AV1 P10.0 / P10.1 / P10.4 with `dav1` / `av01` track type + `dvvC` box (per Apple HLS Authoring Spec + Dolby ETSI TS 103 572). Both engage the tvOS HDMI DV handshake on DV-capable displays |
| HLG         | Transfer function detected and signaled                                                                                     |
| HDR to SDR  | Handled by AVPlayer / system compositor based on the connected display; no host-side tonemap                                |
| Audio       | AAC, AC3, EAC3, FLAC, MP2, MP3, Opus, Vorbis, TrueHD, MLP, DTS, DTS-HD MA, ALAC, PCM. Codecs that stream-copy into fMP4 (AAC, AC3, EAC3, FLAC, ALAC) pass through losslessly. Non-streamable codecs route through `AudioBridge` in one of two modes (`AudioBridgeMode`): `.surroundCompat` (default, EAC3 at 128 kbps per channel — 256 kbps stereo, 768 kbps 5.1 — lossy but surround works on every modern soundbar via the bitstream tunnel) or `.lossless` (FLAC up to 7.1, lossless, needs an AVR that accepts multichannel LPCM over HDMI). |
| Dolby Atmos | EAC3+JOC stream-copied through the HLS-fMP4 wrapper, played back by AVPlayer with Dolby MAT 2.0 unwrap downstream. TrueHD-MAT object metadata is not preserved through the bridge in either mode (FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder doesn't produce JOC, which is the Dolby-licensed Atmos-in-EAC3 extension).        |
| Surround    | 5.1 / 7.1 with correct `AudioChannelLayout` preserved through the wrapper                                                   |
| Subtitles   | SubRip / ASS / SSA / WebVTT / mov_text streamed inline; PGS / HDMV PGS / DVB / DVD rendered as `CGImage` with normalised position; sidecar `.srt` / `.ass` / `.vtt` URLs decoded via short-lived context |
| Frames      | Still-image extraction off-playback via `FrameExtractor`: `thumbnail` (nearest keyframe, downscaled, fast, for scrub previews / Recents) and `snapshot` (frame-accurate, full resolution, for user stills), both as `CGImage`. Isolated FFmpeg decode context, bounded LRU cache, idle-close lifecycle |
| Seek        | Producer teardown + restart for backward / far-forward scrubs; short-range forward scrubs ride the cached segment window    |
| Streaming   | HTTP Range + chunked delegate reads via `URLSession`                                                                        |
| Live        | Scaffold-level: `LoadOptions.isLive` opts the session in; engine publishes `@Published var isLive` for hosts, ignores `seek()`. H.264 / HEVC inside MPEG-TS routes through the native AVPlayer pipeline; MPEG-2 / MPEG-4 / VC-1 / VP8 / VP9 inside MPEG-TS routes through the SW pipeline. Sliding-window segment eviction for unbounded sessions is not yet implemented (long native-path sessions will accumulate cached segments) |
| Resilience  | Exponential backoff on transient network errors, background pause, display-link aware lifecycle                             |

## Quick start

```swift
import AetherEngine
import SwiftUI

let player = try AetherEngine()

// SwiftUI: drop AetherPlayerSurface anywhere in the view tree
var body: some View {
    AetherPlayerSurface(engine: player)
}

// UIKit / AppKit: bind an AetherPlayerView directly
let surface = AetherPlayerView()
player.bind(view: surface)

try await player.load(url: videoURL)                                        // or
try await player.load(url: videoURL, startPosition: 347.5)                  // resume
try await player.load(
    url: videoURL,
    options: .init(
        httpHeaders: headers,             // attached to every demux + segment fetch
        matchContentEnabled: matchContent // tvOS Match Content master toggle
    )
)
try await player.reloadAtCurrentPosition()  // background reopen, preserves options

player.play()
player.pause()
player.setRate(1.5)
await player.seek(to: 120)
player.stop()

// Observe (Combine @Published)
player.$state         // .idle, .loading, .playing, .paused, .seeking, .error
player.$currentTime   // AVPlayer's HLS clock (use for transport / scrub / resume)
player.$sourceTime    // source PTS of the displayed frame (use for subtitle alignment)
player.$duration
player.$videoFormat   // .sdr, .hdr10, .hdr10Plus, .dolbyVision, .hlg
player.$currentAVPlayer  // active AVPlayer, re-emitted on every reload (MPNowPlayingSession)

player.audioTracks    // [TrackInfo]
player.selectAudioTrack(index: trackID)

// Info panel / Now Playing (iOS / tvOS)
player.setExternalMetadata([
    AVMetadataItem(/* title, artwork, etc. */)
])

// Subtitles, text and bitmap, one published list
player.subtitleTracks                          // [TrackInfo] for the loaded source
player.selectSubtitleTrack(index: streamID)    // embedded, text or bitmap
player.selectSidecarSubtitle(url: srtURL)      // .srt / .ass / .vtt next to the media
player.clearSubtitle()
player.$subtitleCues                           // [SubtitleCue], body is .text(String) or .image(SubtitleImage)
player.$isSubtitleActive                       // host mirror gate
player.$isLoadingSubtitles                     // sidecar fetch + decode in progress

// Still frames, off-playback (scrub preview, snapshot, Recents thumbnail)
let frames = player.makeFrameExtractor()           // for the currently loaded URL, or nil
// or, for an arbitrary item: FrameExtractor(url:httpHeaders:)
await frames?.prewarm()                            // open the decode context ahead of a scrub
let thumb = await frames?.thumbnail(at: 612.0)     // nearest keyframe, downscaled (maxWidth: 320)
let still = await frames?.snapshot(at: 612.0)      // frame-accurate, full resolution
await frames?.shutdown()                           // prompt teardown (else idle-closes after 10 s)
```

Subtitle cues land in raw source PTS. On the native path, AVPlayer's HLS clock sits at `source_pts - producer.videoShiftPts` (the producer applies a per-session shift to align the first segment's tfdt with the playlist origin, and the shift can change on every restart). Render the overlay against `player.sourceTime` so cues match the spoken audio regardless of which producer session is active.

Install via Swift Package Manager:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine", from: "2.0.0")
```

Two complementary samples ship in `Examples/`:

- [`MinimalPlayer/`](Examples/MinimalPlayer/MinimalPlayerApp.swift) — 90-line SwiftUI drop-in for developers integrating the engine. Copy the file into a new Xcode tvOS / iOS / macOS app, point at a URL, run.
- [`DemoPlayerMac/`](Examples/DemoPlayerMac/README.md) — standalone macOS app for testers wanting to exercise the engine against their own media without writing host code. Drop a file onto the window, it plays. Pre-built universal `.dmg` is attached to every [GitHub Release](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/latest) (notarized, runs cleanly through Gatekeeper).

## Host setup on tvOS

For HDR / Dolby Vision sources to play reliably on tvOS 26.5+, the
engine must drive `AVDisplayManager.preferredDisplayCriteria` itself
(synchronously, before the AVPlayerItem assignment). Apple Tech Talk
503 has prescribed this ordering since 2017, and tvOS 26.5 now
enforces it synchronously at HLS variant validation: the validator
rejects variants whose `VIDEO-RANGE` the panel can't currently host
with `AVFoundationErrorDomain -11868 / AVErrorNoCompatibleAlternatesForExternalDisplay`,
before fetching the `EXT-X-MAP` init segment, producing
`item.status = .failed` with zero `errorLog().events`. SDR variants
are unaffected since SDR is universally supported.

AVKit-auto criteria (`appliesPreferredDisplayCriteriaAutomatically = true`)
cannot satisfy this contract for HLS multivariant HDR sources because
AVKit reads criteria from `AVAsset.preferredDisplayCriteria`, which
is synthesized from the chosen variant's `CMVideoFormatDescription`,
which only exists after `init.mp4` is parsed, which only happens
after the variant passes the validator. Chicken-and-egg.

Engine-driven sole-writer is the working pattern:

```swift
// In your AVPlayerViewController subclass
playerVC.appliesPreferredDisplayCriteriaAutomatically = false

// When loading
try await engine.load(
    url: url,
    options: LoadOptions(
        suppressDisplayCriteria: false,      // default; engine writes criteria
        matchContentEnabled: matchContent,   // tvOS Match Content master toggle
        panelIsInHDRMode: panelInHDRMode     // current EDR-headroom > 1.0
    )
)
```

`LoadOptions.suppressDisplayCriteria` defaults to `false` so the
engine-driven path is the default. The engine's `apply()` runs
synchronously inside `load(url:)`, then `waitForSwitch` blocks
until the panel reaches the target mode or 5 s timeout, then
`replaceCurrentItem` runs against an already-correct panel mode.

## Playback pipeline

AetherEngine has two playback pipelines, picked once at `load(url:)` based on the source's video codec:

**Native AVPlayer pipeline (default).** Demux the source with libavformat, re-mux the elementary streams on the fly into HLS-fMP4, serve them from a local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<port>`, point `AVPlayer` at the playlist. Apple's stack does all decode, all HDR / Dolby Vision signaling over HDMI, all audio routing. This is the path for HEVC and H.264, which is what AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline reliably accepts. Atmos passthrough, DV HDMI handshake, HDR10 / HDR10+ system-side tone-mapping all live on this path.

```

**Software decoder pipeline (AV1 + VP9 + VP8 + legacy fallback).** Demux the source, run video packets through libavcodec (dav1d for AV1, FFmpeg's native decoder for VP9 / VP8 / MPEG-4 Part 2 / MPEG-2 / VC-1) into `CVPixelBuffer`s, run audio through libavcodec into `CMSampleBuffer`s, render via `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` + `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` with `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer` as the master clock. Used for codecs AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline doesn't accept: AV1 (no AV1 decoder on tvOS at all; Apple ships dav1d on iOS / macOS only, no Apple TV chip has HW AV1), VP9 / VP8 (AVPlayer parses the HLS manifest, sees `vp09` / `vp08` in the CODECS attribute, then silently stops fetching — `item.status` never leaves `.unknown`. VideoToolbox HW-decodes VP9 fine, but only outside the HLS pipeline), and legacy MPEG-4 Part 2 (XVID / DIVX / SP / ASP), MPEG-2 video, and VC-1 (none of `mp4v.20.X` / `mp2v` / `vc-1` are in Apple's HLS Authoring Spec CODECS list).

AV1+DV (Profile 10.0 / 10.1 / 10.4) routes through the native path on hardware-AV1 hosts via the `dav1` / `av01` track type plus the source's `dvvC` box. AV1+Atmos is genuinely rare in the wild (mastering still runs in HEVC overwhelmingly), so the SW pipeline's lack of Atmos passthrough is a theoretical limitation rather than a real one. The dispatch happens once at load time; hosts see a unified `@Published` state surface either way.

Why HLS-fMP4 for the native path instead of feeding `AVPlayer` the source URL directly: AVPlayer's progressive-download path won't accept arbitrary MKV containers, and even for MP4 sources it's brittle around Dolby Vision sample-description quirks and EAC3 `dec3` box variants. The HLS-fMP4 wrapper is the most permissive surface AVPlayer exposes; libavformat's `hls` muxer produces bytes byte-identical to `ffmpeg -f hls -hls_segment_type fmp4`, which is what Apple's HLS spec is defined against.

### Dolby Atmos

EAC3+JOC packets are stream-copied through the muxer untouched. AVPlayer reads the segment, recognises JOC from the `dec3` box (`numDepSub=1`, `depChanLoc=0x0100`), and hands the bitstream to the HDMI output as Dolby MAT 2.0. The AVR lights up the Atmos indicator. The engine emits an explicit `[HLSVideoEngine] EAC3+JOC Atmos: stream-copy engaged, MAT 2.0 passthrough intact` diagnostic on every Atmos session so the path is unambiguous in the log.

Matroska CodecPrivate doesn't usually carry the pre-parsed `dec3` / `dac3` box content the mov muxer needs at `avformat_write_header` time, so the muxer is configured with `+delay_moov` (alongside `+empty_moov+default_base_moof+frag_custom`). The moov atom is deferred until the first fragment-cut flush, by which point packets have flowed through `mov_write_packet` and libavformat's `handle_eac3` / `handle_ac3` have populated the sample-entry boxes from the actual packet bitstream. The first cut emits the deferred ftyp+moov (routed by `FragmentSplitter` to init.mp4); subsequent cuts emit normal moof+mdat for the segment files. Net effect: EAC3 / AC3 from matroska direct-play stream-copies cleanly with valid sample-entries, no manual bitstream parsing on the host side.

For codecs that fMP4 doesn't accept directly (TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD MA, MP3, Opus), `AudioBridge` decodes to PCM and re-encodes in one of two modes. By default (`AudioBridgeMode.surroundCompat`) it produces lossy EAC3 at 128 kbps per channel (256 kbps stereo, 768 kbps 5.1): AVPlayer hands the encoded bitstream to HDMI and the sink decodes its own 5.1 mix, so surround works on essentially every modern AVR and soundbar (Sonos Arc, Samsung HW-Q, Bose). The opt-in alternative (`.lossless`) produces FLAC up to 7.1 lossless, which AVPlayer decodes to LPCM. The lossless path needs an AVR that accepts multichannel LPCM via HDMI (Denon, Marantz, NAD); on soundbars and basic AVRs that handle multichannel only via bitstream codecs the LPCM gets downmixed to stereo at the route. Hosts pick the mode through `LoadOptions.audioBridgeMode`; `.surroundCompat` is the default because the soundbar / basic-AVR install base is the majority. Atmos / TrueHD-MA object metadata is lost in either mode: FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder doesn't produce JOC (Dolby-licensed Atmos-in-EAC3 extension), and FLAC has no object channel concept. If a JOC source ever falls through to the bridge for whatever reason the engine logs a loud `WARNING: Atmos downgrade — ...` so the silent quality regression doesn't go unnoticed.

## HDR routing

| Source                              | Wrapper signaling                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| H.264, HEVC (SDR)                   | BT.709                                                            |
| HEVC Main10 (HDR10)                 | BT.2020 / PQ                                                      |
| HEVC Main10 (HDR10+)                | BT.2020 / PQ + per-frame ST 2094-40 SEI stream-copied             |
| HEVC Main10 (DV P5 / P8.1 / P8.4)   | `dvh1` / `dvhe` track type with the source's `dvcC` box preserved |
| HEVC Main10 (HLG)                   | BT.2020 / HLG                                                     |
| AV1 HDR                             | BT.2020 / PQ                                                      |

HDR-to-SDR mapping is handled by AVPlayer and the system compositor according to the connected display. AetherEngine doesn't tonemap on the host; it tells the system "this is BT.2020 PQ" (or DV, or HLG) via the HLS-fMP4 sample description and lets tvOS / iOS pick the right path.

`DisplayCriteriaController` issues the HDMI content-frame-rate and dynamic-range hint via `AVDisplayManager` before the first segment is fetched, so the receiver-side handshake is in flight by the time `AVPlayer` is ready to render.

### Dolby Vision signaling

For DV streams the demuxer surfaces the source's `AVDOVIDecoderConfigurationRecord`. On DV-capable displays, `HLSVideoEngine` writes the matching ISO BMFF `dvcC` box into the HLS-fMP4 sample description and emits a bare `dvh1.<profile>.<dvLevel>` codec tag for Profile 5, 8.1, and 8.4 so AVKit's auto-criteria reads `dvh1` from the sample entries and engages DV mode directly. On non-DV displays the engine downgrades to plain `hvc1`: Profile 5 is unplayable there (no HDR10 base), and Profiles 8.1 / 8.4 fall back to their HDR10 / HLG base layer with AVPlayer's tone-mapping path. AV1+DV (Profile 10.0 / 10.1 / 10.4) uses the parallel `dav1` / `av01` track type plus `dvvC` box on hardware-AV1 hosts.

### HDR10+ dynamic metadata

ST 2094-40 metadata stays attached to the HEVC bitstream as user-data-registered ITU-T T.35 SEI NALs. The HLS-fMP4 stream-copy preserves the SEI through to `AVPlayer`, which forwards it to the system compositor. HDR10+-capable TVs apply the per-scene tone-mapping curves; HDR10-only TVs fall back to the static HDR10 base.

The published `videoFormat` starts at `.hdr10` for any BT.2020 / PQ source and flips to `.hdr10Plus` the first time a packet's T.35 SEI signature is seen in the producer's scan. Debounced across producer restarts so a scrub doesn't re-fire. Hosts can drive an HDR10+ badge or analytics hook off the `$videoFormat` transition.

## Subtitles

Subtitle packets are routed through the same demux loop as audio and video. No second AVIO connection, no full-file scan. Each packet decodes inline through `avcodec_decode_subtitle2`, the result lands in a single `[SubtitleCue]` published list:

- **Text codecs** (SubRip / ASS / SSA / WebVTT / mov_text) → `SubtitleCue.body = .text(String)`. ASS dialogue headers and override blocks (`{\an8}`, `{\b1}`, ...) are stripped; `\N` becomes a real newline so the host can render with regular text layout.
- **Bitmap codecs** (PGS / HDMV PGS / DVB / DVD) → `.image(SubtitleImage)`. The indexed pixel plane is walked through its palette, premultiplied against alpha, and wrapped as a `CGImage`. Position is normalised in `[0..1]` against the source video frame so the host scales to any on-screen rect.
- **Sidecar files** (a separate `.srt` / `.ass` / `.vtt` URL) → `selectSidecarSubtitle(url:)` opens its own short-lived `AVFormatContext`, decodes the whole file once, atomically swaps the result into `subtitleCues`.

A single packet that carries multiple rects (PGS often emits signs/songs at the top alongside dialogue at the bottom) becomes multiple cues at the same time range, and the host renders all of them. Cues are inserted in sorted order; backward seeks dedupe by `start|end` so the list doesn't grow on rewind.

The host stays in charge of the actual paint: text styling, overlay layout, fade transitions, position scaling against the on-screen video rect.

## Frame extraction

`FrameExtractor` produces still `CGImage`s from a media URL through an FFmpeg decode context that is fully isolated from playback. It never touches the playback pipeline, the HLS loopback server, or the engine's shared state, so a scrub-preview decode can't perturb the frame on screen. Two modes share one decode core:

- **`thumbnail(at:maxWidth:)`**: seeks to the nearest keyframe, no forward decode, downscaled to `maxWidth` (default 320). Cheap and fast; built for scrub previews and Recents lists.
- **`snapshot(at:maxSize:)`**: decodes forward to the exact PTS, full or `maxSize`-clamped resolution. Built for user-triggered stills.

```swift
// For the currently-playing item:
let frames = engine.makeFrameExtractor()           // nil if nothing is loaded

// For an arbitrary item (e.g. a Recents row), construct directly:
let frames = FrameExtractor(url: url, httpHeaders: headers)

await frames.prewarm()                             // optional: hide cold-start at gesture begin
let preview = await frames.thumbnail(at: 612.0)    // CGImage?, nearest keyframe
let still   = await frames.snapshot(at: 612.0)     // CGImage?, frame-accurate
await frames.shutdown()                            // prompt teardown of the decode context
```

`FrameExtractor` is an `actor`. Blocking FFmpeg work runs on a dedicated serial queue, never on the cooperative thread pool. The decode context opens lazily on first use; a superseded request (the common case during an active scrub) cancels the in-flight decode so the latest position wins. Results land in a bounded LRU cache (snapshots and thumbnails kept in separate stores, thumbnails bucketed by second). After 10 s idle the context closes and the cache drops automatically; the next request reopens lazily. `shutdown()` is the explicit, permanent teardown: it awaits release of the FFmpeg demuxer / codec / sws resources and refuses further work. The engine does not retain the extractor returned by `makeFrameExtractor()`; the caller owns its lifecycle.

## aetherctl

A standalone macOS CLI is shipped alongside the library for repro
work without going through TestFlight + Apple TV. Five subcommands,
all operating on a media source URL (`file://` or `http(s)://`):

```bash
swift run aetherctl probe <url>          # dump container + streams + duration, exit
swift run aetherctl serve <url>          # park the engine's loopback HLS-fMP4 server
swift run aetherctl validate <url>       # serve + run mediastreamvalidator, exit
swift run aetherctl swdecode <url>       # open SoftwareVideoDecoder, decode N packets, report
swift run aetherctl extract <url>        # FrameExtractor still-image extraction + leak testing
swift run aetherctl <url>                # alias for serve (backwards compat)
```

`probe` opens the demuxer, prints the codec / resolution / frame rate
of the video track, the audio track list (codec, channels, language,
Atmos flag), the subtitle track list, then exits. No HLS server is
started.

`serve` is the original behavior. The CLI prints the loopback URL and
parks until Ctrl-C; from another terminal you can:

```bash
curl -i  http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8
curl -o  /tmp/init.mp4   http://127.0.0.1:<port>/init.mp4
mediastreamvalidator http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8
mp4dump --verbosity 1 /tmp/init.mp4
ffprobe -v debug /tmp/seg0.mp4
open 'http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8'   # macOS QuickTime
```

`validate` is the same plus an inline `xcrun mediastreamvalidator`
run against the loopback manifest, with the report printed and the
engine torn down on completion.

`swdecode` opens `SoftwareVideoDecoder` for the source's video stream,
feeds up to N packets (default 100, override with `--frames N`),
and reports counters plus first-frame metadata (pixel format,
dimensions). Tests the SW-pipeline decode path end-to-end without
needing a render layer. Useful for legacy codecs (MPEG-4 Part 2,
MPEG-2, VC-1) and AV1 / VP9 on platforms where the native AVPlayer
path doesn't accept them. Verdict distinguishes between three
failure modes:

- decoder open failed (FFmpegBuild gate or malformed extradata)
- decoder opened but no frames produced (pixel-format conversion,
  no IDR in window)
- SW decode end-to-end healthy (if real playback still hangs, the
  failure is downstream in `SoftwarePlaybackHost` frame-enqueue,
  display-layer attach, or audio-clock sync)

Backed by the public `AetherEngine.swDecodeProbe(url:maxPackets:options:)`
static API returning `SoftwareDecodeProbeResult`. Hosts can use the
same probe in their own diagnostic overlays.

`extract` opens a `FrameExtractor` against the source and pulls a
still frame. Thumbnail mode (default) snaps to the nearest keyframe
and downscales to `--width` (default 320); `--snapshot` decodes
frame-accurately at full resolution. `--at <sec>` sets the seek
position (default 60.0). The first frame is written to
`/tmp/aetherctl-extract-<mode>.png`. `--loops N` repeats the
extraction across eight cycling positions, which pairs with
`leaks --atExit` to validate the decode-context teardown is clean:

```bash
swift run aetherctl extract --at 612 --snapshot <url>          # frame-accurate still
swift run aetherctl extract --width 480 <url>                  # keyframe thumbnail
leaks --atExit -- .build/debug/aetherctl extract --loops 8 <url>   # leak sweep
```

For repeatable runs, `Scripts/fetch-fixtures.sh` generates a small
set of synthetic FFmpeg test clips in `./Fixtures/` (H.264 SDR,
HEVC HDR10, AV1, VP9) covering both the native AVPlayer path and
the software fallback. Real-world DV / Atmos / multichannel sources
go in `./Fixtures/user/` (gitignored).

## Non-goals

Things AetherEngine deliberately doesn't do, so you don't have to read the source to find out:

- No built-in UI. No controls, no transport bar, no pretty HUD.
- No external analytics or session reporting. A 1 Hz `@Published liveTelemetry: LiveTelemetry?` surface is provided for host UIs that want to render runtime stats locally; nothing leaves the device.
- No playlist / queue management. Call `load(url:)` when you want the next one.
- No subtitle overlay. The engine decodes packets and emits `SubtitleCue` (text or `CGImage` with normalised position); your UI paints them with whatever style and animation you want.
- No Metal shaders. Everything renders through Apple's native display stack.
- No third-party networking. `URLSession` handles bytes; TLS / HTTP-3 / proxies / MDM rules ride for free.

## Known limitations

Things that work today but have a documented edge case, or are deferred behind an upstream dependency:

- **TrueHD-MAT Atmos object metadata is not preserved.** TrueHD / MLP sources route through the AudioBridge (FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder doesn't produce JOC, which is the Dolby-licensed Atmos-in-EAC3 extension). Bed channels and surround layout survive; object metadata is dropped. EAC3+JOC stream-copy from MKV / MP4 sources is intact.
- **`.surroundCompat` audio bridge caps 7.1 sources to 5.1.** FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder currently caps at 6 channels. Once [FFmpeg PR 21668](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/pull/21668) lands the cap and the dynamic bitrate auto-scale to 1024 kbps engage without a code change here. Use `.lossless` (FLAC) today if 7.1 matters.
- **Manual `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` writes race the HLS-loopback path on tvOS 26.** The combination produces a `libdispatch` race. Only `AVPlayerViewController` with its standard transport bar safely surfaces Now Playing. Hosts that need a custom transport should use `MPNowPlayingSession` against the engine's `currentAVPlayer` publisher instead of `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo`.
- **HDMI route reports ch=2 → multichannel plays as stereo.** When the sink reports a 2-channel audio route (`AVAudioSession.outputNumberOfChannels == 2`), all non-Atmos multichannel material downmixes to stereo. This is a sink-side issue (some AVRs cache HDMI EDID incorrectly after standby). Power-cycling the sink restores the correct route. Atmos passthrough still works on these routes because EAC3+JOC ships as MAT 2.0 over a 2-channel carrier.
- **Live MPEG-TS sliding-window segment eviction is not yet implemented.** `LoadOptions.isLive` enables the scaffold (no-op seek, `@Published isLive`), but long-running live sessions on the native AVPlayer path accumulate cached segments. Live VOD playback works; multi-hour IPTV / broadcaster feeds will grow memory until the source ends.
- **AV1 on Apple TV is software-decoded.** No current Apple TV chip ships HW AV1. The `SoftwarePlaybackHost` + dav1d path handles it, but CPU use is meaningfully higher than HW HEVC. On iOS 17+ / macOS 14+ AV1 routes through Apple's HW pipeline transparently. Future Apple TV chips with HW AV1 will be picked up automatically by `VTCapabilityProbe`.
- **AV1 Dolby Vision Profile 10.0 has wrong colours when software-decoded.** dav1d / libavcodec cannot decode the proprietary DV colour space, so a Profile 10.0 source (DV-only, no fallback base layer) renders with incorrect colours on the SW path. Profiles 10.1 and 10.4 are unaffected because they carry an HDR10 / HLG base layer that the decoder reads correctly. Profile 10.0 only renders correctly through the native AVPlayer path on hosts with HW AV1 decode (M3+ Mac, iPhone 15 Pro+, future Apple TV chips); on software-decode hosts (all current Apple TVs) it is a known colour limitation.

## Stability and versioning

AetherEngine uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). The public API surface — every `public` declaration in `Sources/AetherEngine/` — is the stability contract:

- **Major (`X.0.0`)**: removes or renames public symbols, changes method signatures, changes default behaviour in a way that breaks adopters.
- **Minor (`X.Y.0`)**: adds public API, adds codec / format support, fixes behaviour that adopters could not reasonably have depended on.
- **Patch (`X.Y.Z`)**: fixes bugs and reliability issues. No public API changes.

`internal` types and properties are not part of the contract and may change in any release. `@testable import AetherEngine` reaches them for the package's own tests, not for production use.

Pin `from: "2.0.0"` in your `Package.swift` to allow patch + minor updates while excluding breaking changes:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine", from: "2.0.0")
```

Pin to `.upToNextMinor(from: "2.0.0")` for stricter teams that prefer to opt into minor bumps explicitly. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the per-release index.

## Support

If the engine is useful to you and you'd like to support its development, there's a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/superuser404).

## Built with

AetherEngine is vibe-coded, designed and shipped by [Vincent Herbst](https://github.com/superuser404notfound) in close pair-programming with **Claude** (Anthropic). The commit log is the receipt: nearly every commit carries a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.

## Testing and feedback

Big thanks to [@DrHurt](https://github.com/DrHurt) for the relentless on-device DV / HDR matrix testing in [#4](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/issues/4). The empirical builds 159-172 sweeps across panel modes (SDR / HDR10 / DV) cross-matched with Match Content states exposed the timing race in `DisplayCriteriaController.waitForSwitch` that the 1.4.0 two-stage poll now fixes.
