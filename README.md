## What it is

A player engine that gets the hard parts right (HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, container coverage, codec coverage) and exposes a single `AetherPlayerView` (UIKit / AppKit) or `AetherPlayerSurface` (SwiftUI) plus a handful of `async` methods. No `AVPlayerViewController`. No opinionated controls. No analytics. Bind the view, call `play()`, read the published properties for state.

The view is polymorphic: under the hood the engine swaps the hosted CALayer (`AVPlayerLayer` for the native AVPlayer path, `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` for the SW dav1d fallback path) per session without the host having to know.

You provide the transport bar. You provide the dropdowns. You provide the pretty.

## What it handles

| Area        | Details                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Containers  | MKV, MP4, WebM, MPEG-TS, AVI, OGG, FLV (demux side)                                                                         |
| HW decode   | H.264, HEVC, HEVC Main10 via VideoToolbox in AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 path. AV1 on devices with HW AV1 (M3+ Mac, iPhone 15 Pro+, future Apple TV chips) also routes natively |
| SW decode   | AV1 (libavcodec/dav1d) on devices without HW AV1 — currently all Apple TVs, M1/M2 Macs, pre-A17-Pro iPhones. VP9 (libavcodec native) unconditionally, since AVPlayer's HLS pipeline rejects the `vp09` CODECS attribute even where VT can HW-decode it. Both render through `SoftwareVideoDecoder` + `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`. Dispatch decision lives in `AetherEngine.load`, gated per source on `VTCapabilityProbe` |
| HDR10       | BT.2020 + PQ signaled via the HLS-fMP4 wrapper; AVPlayer hands the bitstream to the system HDR pipeline                     |
| HDR10+      | Per-frame ST 2094-40 dynamic metadata preserved through stream-copy into the HLS-fMP4 wrapper                               |
| Dolby Vision| HEVC P5 / P8.1 / P8.4 with `dvh1` / `hvc1` track type + `dvcC` box. AV1 P10.0 / P10.1 / P10.4 with `dav1` / `av01` track type + `dvvC` box (per Apple HLS Authoring Spec + Dolby ETSI TS 103 572). Both engage the tvOS HDMI DV handshake on DV-capable displays |
| HLG         | Transfer function detected and signaled                                                                                     |
| HDR to SDR  | Handled by AVPlayer / system compositor based on the connected display; no host-side tonemap                                |
| Audio       | AAC, AC3, EAC3, FLAC, MP3, Opus, Vorbis, TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD MA, ALAC, PCM. Codecs that stream-copy into fMP4 (AAC, AC3, EAC3, FLAC, ALAC) pass through losslessly. Non-streamable codecs route through `AudioBridge` in one of two modes (`AudioBridgeMode`): `.surroundCompat` (default, EAC3 5.1 at 384 kbps, lossy but surround works on every modern soundbar via the bitstream tunnel) or `.lossless` (FLAC up to 7.1, lossless, needs an AVR that accepts multichannel LPCM over HDMI). |
| Dolby Atmos | EAC3+JOC stream-copied through the HLS-fMP4 wrapper, played back by AVPlayer with Dolby MAT 2.0 unwrap downstream. TrueHD-MAT object metadata is not preserved through the bridge in either mode (FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder doesn't produce JOC, which is the Dolby-licensed Atmos-in-EAC3 extension).        |
| Surround    | 5.1 / 7.1 with correct `AudioChannelLayout` preserved through the wrapper                                                   |
| Subtitles   | SubRip / ASS / SSA / WebVTT / mov_text streamed inline; PGS / HDMV PGS / DVB / DVD rendered as `CGImage` with normalised position; sidecar `.srt` / `.ass` / `.vtt` URLs decoded via short-lived context |
| Seek        | Producer teardown + restart for backward / far-forward scrubs; short-range forward scrubs ride the cached segment window    |
| Streaming   | HTTP Range + chunked delegate reads via `URLSession`                                                                        |
| Resilience  | Exponential backoff on transient network errors, background pause, display-link aware lifecycle                             |

## Quick start

```swift
import AetherEngine
import SwiftUI

let player = try AetherEngine()

// SwiftUI: drop AetherPlayerSurface anywhere in the view tree
var body: some View {
    AetherPlayerSurface(engine: player)
}

// UIKit / AppKit: bind an AetherPlayerView directly
let surface = AetherPlayerView()
player.bind(view: surface)

try await player.load(url: videoURL)                                        // or
try await player.load(url: videoURL, startPosition: 347.5)                  // resume
try await player.load(
    url: videoURL,
    options: .init(
        httpHeaders: headers,             // attached to every demux + segment fetch
        matchContentEnabled: matchContent // tvOS Match Content master toggle
    )
)
try await player.reloadAtCurrentPosition()  // background reopen, preserves options

player.play()
player.pause()
player.setRate(1.5)
await player.seek(to: 120)
player.stop()

// Observe (Combine @Published)
player.$state         // .idle, .loading, .playing, .paused, .seeking, .error
player.$currentTime   // AVPlayer's HLS clock (use for transport / scrub / resume)
player.$sourceTime    // source PTS of the displayed frame (use for subtitle alignment)
player.$duration
player.$videoFormat   // .sdr, .hdr10, .hdr10Plus, .dolbyVision, .hlg
player.$currentAVPlayer  // active AVPlayer, re-emitted on every reload (MPNowPlayingSession)

player.audioTracks    // [TrackInfo]
player.selectAudioTrack(index: trackID)

// tvOS info panel / Now Playing
player.setExternalMetadata([
    AVMetadataItem(/* title, artwork, etc. */)
])

// Subtitles, text and bitmap, one published list
player.subtitleTracks                          // [TrackInfo] for the loaded source
player.selectSubtitleTrack(index: streamID)    // embedded, text or bitmap
player.selectSidecarSubtitle(url: srtURL)      // .srt / .ass / .vtt next to the media
player.clearSubtitle()
player.$subtitleCues                           // [SubtitleCue], body is .text(String) or .image(SubtitleImage)
player.$isSubtitleActive                       // host mirror gate
player.$isLoadingSubtitles                     // sidecar fetch + decode in progress
```

Subtitle cues land in raw source PTS. On the native path, AVPlayer's HLS clock sits at `source_pts - producer.videoShiftPts` (the producer applies a per-session shift to align the first segment's tfdt with the playlist origin, and the shift can change on every restart). Render the overlay against `player.sourceTime` so cues match the spoken audio regardless of which producer session is active.

Install via Swift Package Manager:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine", branch: "main")
```

## Playback pipeline

AetherEngine has two playback pipelines, picked once at `load(url:)` based on the source's video codec:

**Native AVPlayer pipeline (default).** Demux the source with libavformat, re-mux the elementary streams on the fly into HLS-fMP4, serve them from a local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<port>`, point `AVPlayer` at the playlist. Apple's stack does all decode, all HDR / Dolby Vision signaling over HDMI, all audio routing. This is the path for HEVC and H.264, which is what AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline reliably accepts. Atmos passthrough, DV HDMI handshake, HDR10 / HDR10+ system-side tone-mapping all live on this path.

```

                                                                         ▼

                                                                         │
                                                                         ├─► VideoToolbox (HW decode)
                                                                         └─► AVR / speakers (Atmos via MAT 2.0)
```

**Software decoder pipeline (AV1 + VP9 fallback).** Demux the source, run video packets through libavcodec (dav1d for AV1, FFmpeg's native VP9 decoder for VP9) into `CVPixelBuffer`s, run audio through libavcodec into `CMSampleBuffer`s, render via `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` + `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` with `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer` as the master clock. Used for codecs AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline doesn't accept: AV1 (no AV1 decoder on tvOS at all; Apple ships dav1d on iOS / macOS only, no Apple TV chip has HW AV1) and VP9 (AVPlayer parses the HLS manifest, sees `vp09` in the CODECS attribute, then silently stops fetching — `item.status` never leaves `.unknown`. VideoToolbox HW-decodes VP9 fine, but only outside the HLS pipeline).

                                              AVR / speakers
```

AV1+DV (Profile 10.0 / 10.1 / 10.4) routes through the native path on hardware-AV1 hosts via the `dav1` / `av01` track type plus the source's `dvvC` box. AV1+Atmos is genuinely rare in the wild (mastering still runs in HEVC overwhelmingly), so the SW pipeline's lack of Atmos passthrough is a theoretical limitation rather than a real one. The dispatch happens once at load time; hosts see a unified `@Published` state surface either way.

Why HLS-fMP4 for the native path instead of feeding `AVPlayer` the source URL directly: AVPlayer's progressive-download path won't accept arbitrary MKV containers, and even for MP4 sources it's brittle around Dolby Vision sample-description quirks and EAC3 `dec3` box variants. The HLS-fMP4 wrapper is the most permissive surface AVPlayer exposes; libavformat's `hls` muxer produces bytes byte-identical to `ffmpeg -f hls -hls_segment_type fmp4`, which is what Apple's HLS spec is defined against.

### Dolby Atmos

EAC3+JOC packets are stream-copied through the muxer untouched. AVPlayer reads the segment, recognises JOC from the `dec3` box (`numDepSub=1`, `depChanLoc=0x0100`), and hands the bitstream to the HDMI output as Dolby MAT 2.0. The AVR lights up the Atmos indicator. The engine emits an explicit `[HLSVideoEngine] EAC3+JOC Atmos: stream-copy engaged, MAT 2.0 passthrough intact` diagnostic on every Atmos session so the path is unambiguous in the log.

Matroska CodecPrivate doesn't usually carry the pre-parsed `dec3` / `dac3` box content the mov muxer needs at `avformat_write_header` time, so the muxer is configured with `+delay_moov` (alongside `+empty_moov+default_base_moof+frag_custom`). The moov atom is deferred until the first fragment-cut flush, by which point packets have flowed through `mov_write_packet` and libavformat's `handle_eac3` / `handle_ac3` have populated the sample-entry boxes from the actual packet bitstream. The first cut emits the deferred ftyp+moov (routed by `FragmentSplitter` to init.mp4); subsequent cuts emit normal moof+mdat for the segment files. Net effect: EAC3 / AC3 from matroska direct-play stream-copies cleanly with valid sample-entries, no manual bitstream parsing on the host side.

For codecs that fMP4 doesn't accept directly (TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD MA, MP3, Opus), `AudioBridge` decodes to PCM and re-encodes in one of two modes. By default (`AudioBridgeMode.surroundCompat`) it produces lossy EAC3 5.1 at 384 kbps: AVPlayer hands the encoded bitstream to HDMI and the sink decodes its own 5.1 mix, so surround works on essentially every modern AVR and soundbar (Sonos Arc, Samsung HW-Q, Bose). The opt-in alternative (`.lossless`) produces FLAC up to 7.1 lossless, which AVPlayer decodes to LPCM. The lossless path needs an AVR that accepts multichannel LPCM via HDMI (Denon, Marantz, NAD); on soundbars and basic AVRs that handle multichannel only via bitstream codecs the LPCM gets downmixed to stereo at the route. Hosts pick the mode through `LoadOptions.audioBridgeMode`; `.surroundCompat` is the default because the soundbar / basic-AVR install base is the majority. Atmos / TrueHD-MA object metadata is lost in either mode: FFmpeg's EAC3 encoder doesn't produce JOC (Dolby-licensed Atmos-in-EAC3 extension), and FLAC has no object channel concept. If a JOC source ever falls through to the bridge for whatever reason the engine logs a loud `WARNING: Atmos downgrade — ...` so the silent quality regression doesn't go unnoticed.

## HDR routing

| Source                              | Wrapper signaling                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| H.264, HEVC (SDR)                   | BT.709                                                            |
| HEVC Main10 (HDR10)                 | BT.2020 / PQ                                                      |
| HEVC Main10 (HDR10+)                | BT.2020 / PQ + per-frame ST 2094-40 SEI stream-copied             |
| HEVC Main10 (DV P5 / P8.1 / P8.4)   | `dvh1` / `dvhe` track type with the source's `dvcC` box preserved |
| HEVC Main10 (HLG)                   | BT.2020 / HLG                                                     |
| AV1 HDR                             | BT.2020 / PQ                                                      |

HDR-to-SDR mapping is handled by AVPlayer and the system compositor according to the connected display. AetherEngine doesn't tonemap on the host; it tells the system "this is BT.2020 PQ" (or DV, or HLG) via the HLS-fMP4 sample description and lets tvOS / iOS pick the right path.

`DisplayCriteriaController` issues the HDMI content-frame-rate and dynamic-range hint via `AVDisplayManager` before the first segment is fetched, so the receiver-side handshake is in flight by the time `AVPlayer` is ready to render.

### Dolby Vision signaling

For DV streams the demuxer surfaces the source's `AVDOVIDecoderConfigurationRecord`. On DV-capable displays, `HLSVideoEngine` writes the matching ISO BMFF `dvcC` box into the HLS-fMP4 sample description and emits a bare `dvh1.<profile>.<dvLevel>` codec tag for Profile 5, 8.1, and 8.4 so AVKit's auto-criteria reads `dvh1` from the sample entries and engages DV mode directly. On non-DV displays the engine downgrades to plain `hvc1`: Profile 5 is unplayable there (no HDR10 base), and Profiles 8.1 / 8.4 fall back to their HDR10 / HLG base layer with AVPlayer's tone-mapping path. AV1+DV (Profile 10.0 / 10.1 / 10.4) uses the parallel `dav1` / `av01` track type plus `dvvC` box on hardware-AV1 hosts.

### HDR10+ dynamic metadata

ST 2094-40 metadata stays attached to the HEVC bitstream as user-data-registered ITU-T T.35 SEI NALs. The HLS-fMP4 stream-copy preserves the SEI through to `AVPlayer`, which forwards it to the system compositor. HDR10+-capable TVs apply the per-scene tone-mapping curves; HDR10-only TVs fall back to the static HDR10 base.

The published `videoFormat` starts at `.hdr10` for any BT.2020 / PQ source and flips to `.hdr10Plus` the first time a packet's T.35 SEI signature is seen in the producer's scan. Debounced across producer restarts so a scrub doesn't re-fire. Hosts can drive an HDR10+ badge or analytics hook off the `$videoFormat` transition.

## Subtitles

Subtitle packets are routed through the same demux loop as audio and video. No second AVIO connection, no full-file scan. Each packet decodes inline through `avcodec_decode_subtitle2`, the result lands in a single `[SubtitleCue]` published list:

- **Text codecs** (SubRip / ASS / SSA / WebVTT / mov_text) → `SubtitleCue.body = .text(String)`. ASS dialogue headers and override blocks (`{\an8}`, `{\b1}`, ...) are stripped; `\N` becomes a real newline so the host can render with regular text layout.
- **Bitmap codecs** (PGS / HDMV PGS / DVB / DVD) → `.image(SubtitleImage)`. The indexed pixel plane is walked through its palette, premultiplied against alpha, and wrapped as a `CGImage`. Position is normalised in `[0..1]` against the source video frame so the host scales to any on-screen rect.
- **Sidecar files** (a separate `.srt` / `.ass` / `.vtt` URL) → `selectSidecarSubtitle(url:)` opens its own short-lived `AVFormatContext`, decodes the whole file once, atomically swaps the result into `subtitleCues`.

A single packet that carries multiple rects (PGS often emits signs/songs at the top alongside dialogue at the bottom) becomes multiple cues at the same time range, and the host renders all of them. Cues are inserted in sorted order; backward seeks dedupe by `start|end` so the list doesn't grow on rewind.

The host stays in charge of the actual paint: text styling, overlay layout, fade transitions, position scaling against the on-screen video rect.

## aetherctl

A standalone macOS CLI is shipped alongside the library for repro
work without going through TestFlight + Apple TV. Three subcommands,
all operating on a media source URL (`file://` or `http(s)://`):

```bash
swift run aetherctl probe <url>     # dump container + streams + duration, exit
swift run aetherctl serve <url>     # park the engine's loopback HLS-fMP4 server
swift run aetherctl validate <url>  # serve + run mediastreamvalidator, exit
swift run aetherctl <url>           # alias for serve (backwards compat)
```

`probe` opens the demuxer, prints the codec / resolution / frame rate
of the video track, the audio track list (codec, channels, language,
Atmos flag), the subtitle track list, then exits. No HLS server is
started.

`serve` is the original behavior. The CLI prints the loopback URL and
parks until Ctrl-C; from another terminal you can:

```bash
curl -i  http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8
curl -o  /tmp/init.mp4   http://127.0.0.1:<port>/init.mp4
mediastreamvalidator http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8
mp4dump --verbosity 1 /tmp/init.mp4
ffprobe -v debug /tmp/seg0.mp4
open 'http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8'   # macOS QuickTime
```

`validate` is the same plus an inline `xcrun mediastreamvalidator`
run against the loopback manifest, with the report printed and the
engine torn down on completion.

For repeatable runs, `Scripts/fetch-fixtures.sh` generates a small
set of synthetic FFmpeg test clips in `./Fixtures/` (H.264 SDR,
HEVC HDR10, AV1, VP9) covering both the native AVPlayer path and
the software fallback. Real-world DV / Atmos / multichannel sources
go in `./Fixtures/user/` (gitignored).

## Non-goals

Things AetherEngine deliberately doesn't do, so you don't have to read the source to find out:

- No built-in UI. No controls, no transport bar, no pretty HUD.
- No analytics, telemetry, or session reporting. Wire your own to the `@Published` state.
- No playlist / queue management. Call `load(url:)` when you want the next one.
- No subtitle overlay. The engine decodes packets and emits `SubtitleCue` (text or `CGImage` with normalised position); your UI paints them with whatever style and animation you want.
- No Metal shaders. Everything renders through Apple's native display stack.
- No third-party networking. `URLSession` handles bytes; TLS / HTTP-3 / proxies / MDM rules ride for free.

## Requirements

| | Min |
| --- | --- |
| iOS | 16.0 |
| tvOS | 16.0 |
| macOS | 14.0 |
| Swift | 6.0 |
| Xcode | 16.0 |

## Used by

- [Sodalite](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/Sodalite): native Jellyfin client for Apple TV.

## Support

If the engine is useful to you and you'd like to support its development, there's a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/superuser404).

## Built with

AetherEngine is vibe-coded, designed and shipped by [Vincent Herbst](https://github.com/superuser404notfound) in close pair-programming with **Claude** (Anthropic). The commit log is the receipt: nearly every commit carries a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.

## License

[LGPL-3.0 with Apple Store / DRM Exception](LICENSE). The exception clause grants explicit permission to distribute through application stores (Apple App Store, TestFlight, etc.) whose terms otherwise conflict with LGPL §4–6. Modifications to the engine itself still have to be released under LGPL.
