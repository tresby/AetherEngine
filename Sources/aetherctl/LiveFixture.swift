// LiveFixture: a synthetic, offline, never-ending MPEG-TS source for
// the `aetherctl live` harness.
//
// Serves an endless MPEG-TS over HTTP loopback by repeating a finite
// seed `.ts` payload, rewriting per-loop timestamps so the served
// stream looks like a genuine live broadcast with monotonically
// advancing PTS / PCR across loop boundaries (a naive byte-repeat
// would reset timestamps to the seed's start every loop, and the
// demuxer would read every loop seam as a discontinuity / backward
// jump).
//
// What gets rewritten per loop:
//   - PCR (adaptation-field, 33-bit base + 9-bit ext at 27 MHz) gets
//     `loopIndex * loopPeriodTicks * 300` added to the base.
//   - PES PTS and DTS (33-bit, 90 kHz) get `loopIndex * loopPeriodTicks`
//     added. The seed here is PTS-only (no DTS), but DTS is handled too
//     so a different seed still works.
//   - Transport continuity_counter (low nibble of the 2nd header byte
//     group, `packet[3] & 0x0F`) keeps incrementing per-PID across loop
//     boundaries instead of restarting at the seed's first value, so
//     the demuxer sees no continuity error at the seam.
//
// `loopPeriodTicks` is (max PTS - min PTS) + one frame interval, so
// loop N+1's first timestamp sits exactly one frame after loop N's
// last, which is what a real CBR feed produces.
//
// No `Content-Length`. The socket streams TS packets until the client
// disconnects (`Connection: close`), so `AVIOReader` + the demuxer see
// a feed with no end. URL shape: `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/live.ts`.
//
// Socket scaffolding (socket / bind / listen / accept / send) mirrors
// `HLSLocalServer` deliberately: Darwin BSD sockets, not
// Network.framework. See that file's header for the rationale.
//
// YAGNI: a single initializer, no drop / discontinuity injection. Later
// tasks add `--drop-after` / `--discontinuity-at`; this fixture is the
// clean baseline.
