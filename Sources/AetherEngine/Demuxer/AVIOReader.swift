/// - **Persistent** (file size known, prefetch enabled — the playback path):
///   a single long-lived `Range: bytes=<pos>-` GET that streams forward into
///   a sliding window. FFmpeg reads are served from the window; a new request
///   is issued ONLY on a real seek outside the window's reach. A connection
///   drop or an early EOF before `fileSize` triggers a reconnect at the last
///   delivered offset instead of being treated as terminal, and CDN
///   rate-limit statuses (429/503) back off and retry. This mirrors VLC's
///   "open once, read forward, reconnect on drop" model and is the fix for
///   AetherEngine#25 (direct-URL playback collapsing on the first CDN
///   stutter / rate-limit). See `readPersistent`.
/// - **Seekable chunked** (file size known, prefetch disabled — the still /
///   frame-extraction path): discrete HTTP Range chunks for random access,
///   where each read seeks elsewhere and a forward stream would be wasted.
///   See `readSeekable`.
/// - **Streaming** (file size unknown/-1): Single GET request, sequential reads.
///   Used for live transcoded streams from Jellyfin. See `readStreaming`.

/// Thread safety: AVIO callbacks run on the demux queue. Prefetch / streaming /
/// persistent-connection delivery runs on dedicated background queues. Shared

    /// Why the previous 8 MB attempt (e327e5e) leaked at 6 MB/sec

    /// URLSession + completion-handler, and URLSession's task object
    /// holds the monolithic response body in its internal state past
    /// the handler invocation until `finishTasksAndInvalidate`
    /// finishes (async). At 6 fetches/sec the pool of pending
    /// sessions piled up faster than invalidation could drain. The
    /// new path skips invalidation entirely: a shared long-lived
    /// session, incremental delivery to a delegate that force-copies
    /// each chunk, source dispatch_data released per delivery. No
    /// monolithic body, no accumulation.
    ///
    /// Trade-off captured: cold-start fetches 8 MB at source bitrate
    /// (~1 s on 50 Mbps 4K HEVC, vs ~10 s at 64 MB). Steady-state
    /// URLSession ops at ~0.8/sec for 50 Mbps source, handled by the

    ///
    /// History of this knob:
    ///   - Long-form leak investigation A/B (with the periodic
    ///     demuxer recycle still active):
    ///       8 MB chunks  → 3.20 MB/s leak
    ///       64 MB chunks → 0.64 MB/s leak
    ///       256 MB chunks → 4.85 MB/s leak + memory warnings
    ///   - 1ee963d removed the recycle and the recycle race that
    ///     drove the bulk of the per-chunk retention. Bounded
    ///     mallocMB (211-291 MB oscillation through 11-min runs)
    ///     was field-measured at 64 MB chunks post-recycle-removal.
    ///   - e327e5e (2026-05-22) drop to 8 MB on the assumption that
    ///     "chunk size doesn't affect leak control after the
    ///     recycle is gone". That assumption was wrong: at 8 MB +
    ///     ~6 ops/sec at 4K HEVC bitrates, the per-request URLSession
    ///     `finishTasksAndInvalidate` (async by design) doesn't
    ///     complete between requests. URLSession instances and
    ///     their internal pools accumulate, and `mallocMB` grows
    ///     linearly at the source bitrate (~6 MB/s on a 50 Mbps
    ///     stream). Reverted to 64 MB after a 5-min Harry Potter
    ///     run hit 1.9 GB / 1.8 GB jetsam range.
    ///
    /// Why 64 MB works where 8 MB doesn't:
    ///   - URLSession ops drop from ~6/sec to ~0.8/sec
    ///   - finishTasksAndInvalidate has time to complete between
    ///     fetches, so the pool of pending sessions stays at ~1-2
    ///     instead of climbing to dozens
    ///   - Per-chunk dispatch_data still goes through force-copy
    ///     (heap-independent Data), so the per-fetch retention is
    ///     bounded; the multiplier was the pool accumulation, not
    ///     individual fetches leaking more
    ///
    /// Cost: cold-start fetches one 64 MB chunk before AVPlayer can
