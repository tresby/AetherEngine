/// In-band CEA-608 closed-caption support for a demuxable caption track (`eia_608` / QuickTime `c608`) (#77).
///
/// Externalised tap: a read-only observer attached to the `HLSSegmentProducer`'s source demuxer (the
/// connection the engine already reads reliably). The producer keeps the `eia_608` caption stream, hands
/// each of its packets to the tap, then drops it (never muxed → output byte-identical). The tap decodes
/// on the pump thread
/// and **owns the cue buffer**, publishing an immutable snapshot to the MainActor whenever it changes.
/// The engine mirrors that snapshot into `subtitleCues` while the CC track is the active subtitle.
///
/// Because the tap holds the full buffer, enabling CC mid-playback shows captions instantly (mirror the
/// snapshot — no producer restart), and a seek that re-pumps an overlapping region can't create duplicate
/// cues (the single buffer owns them). `makeProducer` re-threads the observer onto every restart, so it
/// survives seek/reload/wedge with no second connection.
///
/// First cut: 608 field-1 / CC1 only (see `CEA608Decoder`). Thread-confined to the pump thread for decode;
/// `@unchecked Sendable` for the observer-closure boundary. Snapshot publication hops to the MainActor.
