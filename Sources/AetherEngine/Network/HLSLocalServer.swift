        //    "Playlist File unchanged for longer than 1.5 * target duration".
        //
        // 2. Transcode warm-up jitter. Even with the startup cushion, the
        //    server's real-time transcode takes a moment to reach steady
        //    throughput. During that warm-up the producer can stall ~8 s
        //    cutting the next segment (the pump blocks in the persistent
        //    reader), and AVPlayer, started one segment behind the edge,
        //    catches the gap and trips -12888 once at startup before
        //    recovering. The fix is patience, not a bigger cushion: a bigger
        //    cushion would add startup latency, whereas advertising a more
        //    generous TARGETDURATION widens the -12888 window at no startup
        //    cost. The segments are still CUT at the producer's target, so
        //    EXTINF stays ~targetSeconds and the playlist-reload cadence is
        //    unaffected; only AVPlayer's unchanged-playlist patience grows.
        //
        // ceil(1.5 * target) = 6 for a 4 s cut gives a 9 s patience window,
        // which clears the observed ~8 s warm-up gap with margin. Per HLS
        // spec TARGETDURATION must be >= every EXTINF; since the producer
        // cuts at targetSeconds, 1.5x comfortably satisfies that for normal
        // segments, and if a produced segment ever exceeds the floor, max()
