/// AetherEngine, format-agnostic video muxer that feeds AVPlayer.
///
/// Open-source LGPL 3.0 engine that takes any source (HTTP, file://,
/// MKV / MP4 / TS containers; AVC / HEVC / VP9 / AV1 codecs) and
/// streams it as HLS-fMP4 over a loopback HTTP server to an internal
/// AVPlayer. The host embeds a single `AetherPlayerView` and calls
/// `engine.load(url:options:)`; the engine handles demux, fMP4 mux,
/// HDMI HDR-mode handshake, frame-rate matching, AVPlayer wiring, and
/// per-frame HDR metadata forwarding.
///
/// ## Architecture
///
/// ```
/// URL → FFmpeg Demuxer → HLS-fMP4 Mux (libavformat) → loopback HTTP
///   → AVPlayer → AVPlayerLayer (hosted by AetherPlayerView)
/// ```
///
/// Audio is stream-copied into the fMP4 when the codec is legal there
/// (AAC, AC3, EAC3 incl. JOC Atmos, FLAC, ALAC, MP3, Opus). Codecs
/// that aren't legal in fMP4 (TrueHD, DTS, etc.) bridge through the
/// engine's FLAC re-encoder so AVPlayer plays them as lossless FLAC.
///
/// ## Quick Start
///
/// ```swift
/// let engine = try AetherEngine()
/// let view = AetherPlayerView()
/// engine.bind(view: view)
/// try await engine.load(url: myVideoURL, options: .init())
/// engine.play()
/// ```
