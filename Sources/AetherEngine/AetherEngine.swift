/// AetherEngine, format-agnostic video muxer that feeds AVPlayer.
///
/// Open-source LGPL 3.0 engine that takes any source (HTTP, file://,
/// MKV / MP4 / TS containers; AVC / HEVC / VP9 / AV1 codecs) and
/// streams it as HLS-fMP4 over a loopback HTTP server to an internal
/// AVPlayer. The host embeds a single `AetherPlayerView` and calls
/// `engine.load(url:options:)`; the engine handles demux, fMP4 mux,
/// HDMI HDR-mode handshake, frame-rate matching, AVPlayer wiring, and
/// per-frame HDR metadata forwarding.
///
/// ## Architecture
///
/// ```
/// URL → FFmpeg Demuxer → HLS-fMP4 Mux (libavformat) → loopback HTTP
///   → AVPlayer → AVPlayerLayer (hosted by AetherPlayerView)
/// ```
///
/// Audio is stream-copied into the fMP4 when the codec is legal there
/// (AAC, AC3, EAC3 incl. JOC Atmos, FLAC, ALAC, MP3, Opus). Codecs
/// that aren't legal in fMP4 (TrueHD, DTS, etc.) bridge through the
/// engine's FLAC re-encoder so AVPlayer plays them as lossless FLAC.
///
/// ## Quick Start
///
/// ```swift
/// let engine = try AetherEngine()
/// let view = AetherPlayerView()
/// engine.bind(view: view)
/// try await engine.load(url: myVideoURL, options: .init())
/// engine.play()
/// ```

        //      tvOS and no Apple TV chip has HW AV1). The probe in
        //      `VTCapabilityProbe.av1Available` decides per-platform.
        //    - VP9: always SW. Empirically AVPlayer's HLS manifest
        //      parser rejects the `vp09` CODECS attribute even though
        //      VideoToolbox can HW-decode the codec — verified via
        //      aetherctl on macOS 26 against a libvpx-vp9 source
        //      (AVPlayer GETs master.m3u8 + media.m3u8 then silently
        //      stops fetching, `item.status` never leaves `.unknown`).
        //    - VP8: always SW. Same HLS-manifest-parser rejection as
        //      VP9; VP8 was never part of the HLS Authoring Spec CODECS
        //      list. Useful for legacy WebM rips.
        //    - MPEG-4 Part 2 (XVID / DIVX / SP / ASP), MPEG-2 video,
        //      VC-1: always SW. AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline does not
        //      accept these codecs (`mp4v.20.X`, `mp2v`, `vc-1` are
        //      not in Apple's HLS Authoring Spec CODECS list).
        //      libavcodec ships native decoders for all three in
        //      FFmpegBuild; SoftwareVideoDecoder is codec-generic.
