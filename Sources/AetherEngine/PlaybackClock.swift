/// High-frequency playback clock, split out of `AetherEngine`'s own
/// `ObservableObject` surface (AetherEngine#29).
///
/// `currentTime` ticks at ~10 Hz from AVPlayer's periodic time
/// observer. While these values lived as `@Published` properties on
/// the engine itself, every tick fired `engine.objectWillChange`, so
/// ANY SwiftUI view observing the engine (via `@ObservedObject` /
/// `@EnvironmentObject`) re-rendered its body 10 times a second even
/// if it only read track lists or playback state. On tvOS that
/// re-render tears down and rebuilds native `Menu` dropdowns, which
/// makes the focused item's highlight flicker at the publish rate.
///
/// The split mirrors AVFoundation's own shape: AVPlayer exposes time
/// via `addPeriodicTimeObserver`, not via KVO-observable state, so
/// time-driven UI opts in explicitly and everything else stays quiet.
///
/// Host usage:
/// - **Polling / one-shot reads** keep working unchanged through the
///   engine's computed forwarders (`engine.currentTime` etc.).
/// - **Time-driven UI** (transport bar, time labels) observes the
///   clock, not the engine: put `@ObservedObject var clock =
///   engine.clock` in the leaf view that renders time, or subscribe
///   to `engine.clock.$currentTime` in a view model. Apply
///   `.throttle` / `.removeDuplicates` downstream for lower rates.
/// - **Everything else** (menus, track pickers, settings panes)
///   observes the engine and no longer re-renders on clock ticks.
