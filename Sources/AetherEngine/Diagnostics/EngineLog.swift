/// Single point where the engine emits human-readable diagnostic

///
///   1. **OSLog** (`os.Logger`, always on): structured per-category
///      logging that shows up in Console.app, `log stream`, and
///      Xcode's debug console, and survives Release builds without
///      a debugger. Filterable per subsystem/category, e.g.
///      `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "de.superuser404.AetherEngine" AND category == "muxer"'`.
///   2. **Host handler** (optional): if a host sets
///      `EngineLog.handler`, every line is mirrored there. Used by
///      apps mirroring into an in-app overlay/ring buffer, and by
///      `aetherctl serve`/`validate`/`probe` to add a timestamp
///      prefix and route to stdout. No stdio fallback inside
///      `EngineLog`; any context that wants live stdout must
///      install a handler explicitly.
///
/// Centralising on `EngineLog.emit(...)` means the call site never
/// has to gate on build config or thread-safety; the dispatch happens
/// here.
