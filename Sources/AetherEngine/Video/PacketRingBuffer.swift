/// A keyframe-indexed, disk-spooled sliding-window ring of compressed
/// packets for the software-decode DVR rewind buffer.
///
/// Packets arrive forward-only from the demux loop via `append`. Old
/// packets are evicted once they fall outside `windowSeconds` behind the
/// current edge, but eviction never cuts to a non-keyframe: the retained
/// span always starts at a decodable keyframe. Rewind reads packets back
/// via `packets(fromPts:)`, which rehydrates bytes from disk lazily.
///
/// Disk layout mirrors SegmentCache: each packet is written as a flat
/// file under the caller-supplied scratch directory, named by a
/// monotonically increasing counter. The in-RAM index holds only the
/// metadata tuple; actual bytes are read back through
/// `Data(contentsOf:, options: .alwaysMapped)` so the kernel manages
/// paging without inflating the process RSS.
///
/// Thread-safety: a single NSLock guards the index. The real caller
/// appends on the demux thread and reads on the seek thread; all public
/// methods lock on entry.
