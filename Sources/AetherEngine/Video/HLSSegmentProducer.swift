/// Why this design: the libavformat HLS-fmp4 output is the same

/// caused AVPlayer to lose A/V sync after a handful of seconds. Letting
/// libavformat own the entire mux + segment-cut decision tree removes
/// that whole surface.

/// Strict-forward-only in this phase: the muxer pumps from the demuxer
