        //     `index`. Otherwise wait — the producer is about to write
        //     seg-0 / seg-1 / seg-2 and we don't want to thrash.
        //   - index below the cache's low edge → backward seek past
        //     the kept window, restart.
        //   - index too far above the cache's high edge → forward
        //     seek past where the producer can reach via backpressure,
        //     restart.
        //   - index nominally within the cache's [min..max] range but
        //     peek failed → could be a real hole OR producer-in-flight
        //     that hasn't yet written this segment. Wait briefly; only
        //     restart if the wait times out. Without this short wait
        //     every restart cascades: producer restarts at N, finishes
        //     writing N, returns to caller; AVPlayer then GETs N+1, but
        //     producer hasn't written N+1 yet so peek returns nil while
        //     cache.range is (N..M) from the previous producer's leftover.
        //     The "hole" branch triggers a fresh restart at N+1, which
        //     repeats the pattern for N+2, N+3, etc. A 2s wait absorbs
        //     the typical 100-500ms producer write cadence and breaks
        //     the cascade. True holes (rare; happen after CC's +10s skip
        //     when AVPlayer rebuffers behind the skip target and the
        //     declareTarget prune evicts a segment AVPlayer will need
        //     later) still trigger a restart after the wait times out.
        // Stale-leftover guard: the request is well below where the
        // current producer was launched. `cache.indexRange()` can still
        // report a lower bound from segments left over by a previous
        // producer (typical case: cold-start probe wrote seg-0 / seg-1
        // before the host's resume target triggered a restart at
        // baseIndex=N), and the range-based branch below would mis-
        // classify the request as "producer is about to write this;
        // wait" and stall on a segment the current producer will never
        // generate. Force a restart at the requested index so the
        // producer relocates to where AVPlayer is actually fetching.

        // wrote it but AVPlayer never fetched it, then a back-scrub
        // re-centred the window and the next slide pruned `index`
        // out from under us). `indexRange()` reports only currently-
