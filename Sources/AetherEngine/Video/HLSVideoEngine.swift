    // MARK: - Measurement spike: sliding-window prototype (superseded)
    //
    // PRODUCTIZED (Task B3): the throwaway `_liveSlidingPrototype` flag and
    // `slidingWindowSize = 12` constant this block originally documented are
    // GONE. A live session now ALWAYS serves a sliding `.live` playlist
    // (no PLAYLIST-TYPE, no ENDLIST, advancing MEDIA-SEQUENCE) sized from
    // `LoadOptions.dvrWindowSeconds` (with a live-only floor) via the shared
    // `LiveWindowSizing` helper, and the cache evicts strictly below the
    // playlist's firstVisible. The stall the spike observed (AVPlayer paused
    // at 81 s) traced to the EVENT-vs-removal contradiction plus an
    // uncoordinated MEDIA-SEQUENCE slide; the `.live` type plus a
    // minSafeSegments floor that keeps AVPlayer's live-edge buffer inside
    // the window removes it. The off-device measurement below is retained
    // as documentation; on-device tvOS RSS verification is pending with the
    // maintainer and is NOT this task's success bar (sustained no-stall
    // playback + advancing MEDIA-SEQUENCE + bounded on-disk bytes is).

    //   caused AVPlayer to lose its place when segments fell off the back.
    //   The measurement is therefore of a stalled, not live-playing session.
    //
    // VERDICT: SLIDING BOUNDS FOOTPRINT: NO (on macOS with this fixture)
    //
    // Key findings:
    //   1. Both configurations show FLAT phys_footprint after the initial
    //      AVPlayer framework load (~90s). The "leak" from the prior EVENT
    //      experiment (3.0->1.3 MB/sec) was likely a different measurement
    //      context or a larger/real-world source. The tiny H.264 fixture
    //      at ~0.5 MB/s does not reproduce linear growth on macOS.
    //   2. The sliding window DID reduce resident_size (on-disk eviction
    //      works: old seg files are removed and resident pages drop).
    //   3. The sliding window BROKE AVPlayer playback (state=paused). This
    //      is expected: a MEDIA-SEQUENCE sliding window without proper
    //      live-edge sync causes AVPlayer to lose the playlist window
    //      mid-play and pause.
    //   4. phys_footprint on macOS includes compressed VM from all loaded
    //      frameworks (~7-8 GB for AVFoundation + Swift runtime + aetherctl
    //      debug binary). On tvOS the equivalent budget is ~500-800 MB.
    //      This measurement is NOT representative of tvOS jetsam pressure.
    //
    // Conclusion for next task:
    //   The on-disk SegmentCache eviction in the sliding prototype does
    //   reduce disk pressure and resident pages. The phys_footprint plateau
    //   on macOS does not prove AVPlayer actually releases segments on tvOS.
    //   A replaceCurrentItem-based periodic rebuild is still the recommended
    //   approach for bounding tvOS jetsam-relevant footprint. This spike
    //   confirmed the measurement harness works and on-disk eviction is
    //   effective; device-level tvOS measurement is needed for a definitive
    //   answer.
    //
    // End of spike documentation. Sliding is now unconditional for a live
    // session (see `LiveWindowSizing`).

        //      No transition needed; HDR10 / HLG signaling lands on a

        //      an HDR10 panel into DV mode per DrHurt's manual remux
        //      test in AetherEngine#4.
        //   2. Panel is in SDR, can do HDR (`displaySupportsHDR`), and
        //      `matchContentEnabled` is on. AVKit drives the panel
        //      transition out of SDR using its own criteria pipeline.
        //   3. Otherwise (SDR-only TV, or HDR-capable TV with Match
        //      Dynamic Range off): the panel won't transition, and a
        //      master playlist claiming HDR while the panel sits in SDR
        //      fails asset open with `Cannot Open` (-11848). Route via
        //      media playlist instead so AVPlayer sees no upfront HDR
        //      hint, opens as generic HEVC, and the display tone-maps
        //      the HDR bitstream to its locked mode.
        //
        // Source-side gate: only HDR or DV sources benefit from master
        // routing in the first place. SDR HEVC has nothing to advertise
        // and stays on the media playlist regardless of panel state.
        //
        // DV5 routing on non-DV panels: ALWAYS media playlist.
        //
        // Two tests on Vincent's HDR10-only Samsung (2026-05-26)
        // empirically disproved the "AVPlayer tone-maps DV→HDR10
        // via the master `dvh1.05` CODECS hint" hypothesis (DrHurt
        // #4 #63):
        //
        //   1. With `CODECS="dvh1.05.06,ec+3"` + `VIDEO-RANGE=PQ`:
        //      AVPlayer rejected with `AVFoundationErrorDomain
        //      -11848 / CoreMediaErrorDomain -15517` — CODECS-string
        //      mismatch caused by the non-standard `ec+3` audio
        //      token (fixed in b5462d7).
        //   2. With `CODECS="dvh1.05.06,ec-3"` + `VIDEO-RANGE=PQ`
        //      (canonical RFC 6381 audio token, otherwise identical
        //      master): AVPlayer still rejected with
        //      `AVFoundationErrorDomain -11868 /
        //      AVErrorNoCompatibleAlternatesForExternalDisplay /
        //      CoreMediaErrorDomain -17223`. Same `errorLog dump: 0
        //      events`, same `tracks count=0`, same `item.duration`
        //      parsed from EXTINFs but no playback.
        //
        // The -11868 vs the earlier -11848 is the actual variant-
        // filter rejection: tvOS 26.5 sees a `dvh1.05` master
        // variant, the panel has no DV capability and no fallback
        // variant exists (P5 has no SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS brand for
        // backward-compat — `/db1p` and `/db4h` only work for P8.1
        // / P8.4), so "no compatible alternates" is the literal
        // truth. Matches the published Apple HLS Authoring Spec
        // contract: real streaming services (Apple TV+, Netflix,
        // Disney+) ship P5 alongside a sibling HDR10 variant for
        // non-DV clients; single-variant P5 master is not a
        // supported pattern on AVPlayer.
        //
        // DrHurt's positive #63 result was on a DV-capable system
        // with HDR10 panel mode active — there the variant filter
        // is lenient because the system reports DV decoder
        // availability. On a true non-DV system the filter is
        // strict and rejects unconditionally.
        //
        // So: P5 on any non-DV panel always routes via media. Plain
        // HEVC base never exists for P5 (IPT-PQ-c2 elementary stream
        // is the only thing the source carries), and AVPlayer's
        // media-playlist tonemap path via the dvh1 sample entry in
        // init.mp4 handles the DV-to-display downgrade internally.
        //
        // DV8.1 and DV8.4 on non-DV panels already downgrade their
        // CODECS string to `hvc1.*` in the HEVC dispatch above + strip
        // DV side data, so the master-side codec filter accepts them

        // generate. Force a restart at the requested index so the
