/// Long-lived fragmented-MP4 muxer driving the HLS-fMP4 segments for

/// accumulated state across the session and caused the long-form 4K
/// HDR HEVC memory leak (the producer-restart diagnostic freed 840 MB
/// in one teardown).
///
/// Earlier iteration: per-segment fresh AVFormatContext. Memory leak
/// solved but produced A/V tfdt mismatches at fragment boundaries —
/// FLAC bridge emits packets at fixed 4096-sample (~85 ms) granularity
/// and matroska interleaves audio AHEAD of video, so the first audio
/// packet of each segment muxer landed ~160 ms BEFORE the video tfdt
/// of the same fragment. AVPlayer accepted the first few segments and
/// then froze with audio drop as drift accumulated. The mp4 muxer's
/// `av_interleaved_write_frame` queue handles cross-stream sync
/// internally; we lost it when we switched to per-segment.
///
/// Current architecture: ONE AVFormatContext for the whole session,
/// configured as a plain `mp4` muxer (not `hls` wrapper) with these
/// movflags:
///
///   +empty_moov         — combined with +delay_moov this means the
///                          moov is written WITHOUT per-sample data
///                          (which lives in fragments instead).
///   +default_base_moof  — relative offsets in tfhd (cleaner fmp4)
///   +frag_custom        — caller controls fragment cuts via
///                          `av_write_frame(ctx, nil)`. Packets enter
///                          via `av_interleaved_write_frame` and
///                          queue in libavformat's interleaver until
///                          cross-stream DTS ordering allows commit
///                          to `mov_write_packet`. At cut time we
///                          must drain the interleaver explicitly
///                          (see `cutFragmentForNextSegment`); the
///                          cut itself bypasses the interleaver and
///                          would otherwise leave still-buffered
///                          packets to spill into the next fragment.
///   +delay_moov         — defers writing the moov atom until the
///                          first `av_write_frame(ctx, nil)` call,
///                          AFTER packets have been queued via

///                          wants, so without delay_moov those
///                          sources fail write_header with -22 /

///                          delay_moov plus libavformat's existing
///                          parsing recovers stream-copy for the
///                          full Atmos JOC chain.
///
///   (notably NOT: +dash, +frag_keyframe — +dash adds a session-long
///   sidx accumulator across fragments; +frag_keyframe would interfere
///   with our explicit fragment-cut control via av_write_frame(nil).)
///
/// Cut sequence: each call to `cutFragmentForNextSegment` first
/// drains libavformat's interleaver via
/// `av_interleaved_write_frame(ctx, nil)`, so any packets still
/// buffered there (waiting for cross-stream DTS catch-up) get
/// committed to mov_write_packet and end up in the segment being
/// cut. It then calls `av_write_frame(ctx, nil)` to trigger
/// `mov_flush_fragment`, which emits the moof+mdat. On the first
/// cut only there's a second `av_write_frame(ctx, nil)` (gated by
/// `moovFlushed`) to handle the +delay_moov wrinkle: depending on
/// interleaver state at the time, FFmpeg may have split the flush
/// across calls, writing the deferred ftyp+moov first and the
/// moof+mdat on the follow-up. When `mov_flush_fragment` already
/// wrote both atoms in the single call, the gated second call is a
/// safe no-op against an empty queue. Subsequent cuts are
/// single-call after the drain.
///
/// Output flow per session:
///
///   1. allocate ONE AVFormatContext (mp4 muxer)
///   2. add video + optional audio streams
///   3. avformat_write_header → emits ftyp + moov via avio callback
///   4. caller pumps packets via writePacket() — muxer queues them
///   5. at each segment boundary the caller calls
///      cutFragmentForNextSegment(_:) → muxer flushes the queued
///      packets as one moof+mdat via avio callback → splitter routes
///      the bytes to the current segment's POSIX file → fd is rotated
///      to the next segment's file
///   6. at session end: finalize() → final flush + write_trailer +
///      free_context
///
/// The `FragmentSplitter` parses the avio output stream and routes
/// the ftyp + moov portion to the init-handler callback (= init.mp4
/// content) and the per-fragment moof + mdat bytes to the currently-
/// open segment file. `mfra` at trailer is discarded.
///
/// AVPlayer compatibility: per Apple's HLS Authoring Spec, fMP4
